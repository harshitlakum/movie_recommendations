# Machine Learning Movie Recommendation System

This repository hosts the code for a machine learning project that develops a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 1M dataset. The project explores SVM and MLP models for predicting user movie ratings and includes a from-scratch implementation of an MLP classifier.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation**: Scripts for loading and preprocessing data.
- **SVM Model**: Implementation and tuning of the SVM classifier.
- **MLP Model**: Custom implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: MLP model implemented in PyTorch for comparison.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `h5py`
- `PyTorch`

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-movie-recommender.git
```

Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Models

Navigate to the project directory and run the scripts as follows:
```
python svm_model.py
python mlp_model.py
```

## Models and Performance

Details on the SVM and MLP models, their hyperparameters, and their test set performance can be found in the respective script files and results section.
